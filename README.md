## A bit about Conditional Probability
 In probability theory, conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event (some particular situation occurring) given that (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) another event has occurred. If the event of interest is A and the event B is known or assumed to have occurred, "the conditional probability of A given B", or "the probability of A under the condition B", is usually written as<br><img src = 'https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/74cbddb93db29a62d522cd6ab266531ae295a0fb'>
 
 Here P(A|B) is the probability that event A occurs given that event B already occured.
